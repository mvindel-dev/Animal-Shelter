The front view is in English although it was made for educational purposes (here we speak catalan or spanish so could be made the front view in one of those idioms but I chosed English so anyone could understand better the front view), all the internal code is in English also so you can understand the code a little better. To run the project you just have to download the repository, enter it with vscode and do npm install in the cli and then ng serve. Feel free to look for bugs or improvements in the code to help me improve my coding skills, all feedback is welcome :)
